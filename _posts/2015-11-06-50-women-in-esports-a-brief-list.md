Sparked by a debate that happened yesterday about female representation and role models in esports/gaming, I decided to compile a list of women in the industry that I enjoy following on Twitter. I've included a little blurb about what they do and a follow button beneath all of them. I encourage you to follow them if you're interested in expanding your horizons to the different voices within our industry.

**As a disclaimer, though**, I wanted to stress that there isn't a "right" or "wrong" way to be a woman in gaming; like guys, they should be able to enjoy, work at and participate in whatever they want to. They are not obligated to educate you, be superhuman or deal with you longer than they want to. Some just want to enjoy their hobby, passion or job, and that's up to them.

This is not meant to be a definitive "valuable women in esports" list. There are definitely people on this list that I am not aware of, and by all means, you should seek them out. If you know of some, **share their stuff** and encourage more people to check out what they're involved in; people sharing their stuff is the best way to help them grow.

By getting a better perspective of these people and how they contribute to esports (again, in as big or a little as a way they want to), I hope we can encourage success and help our ecosystem thrive.

If any of the people listed want to be removed from this post, please feel free to get in contact.
