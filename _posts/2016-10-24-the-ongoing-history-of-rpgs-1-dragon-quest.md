This is the first episode of _The Ongoing History of RPGs_, and I figured I'd start it off with a series I really enjoy, but ironically haven't played too much of. _Dragon Quest_, despite not being as big as _Final Fantasy_ in the West, is one of the most important titles in the RPG genre; it gave players an accessible way to enjoy a story while innovating mechanics that are still being used today.
